## Getting Started
**Prerequisites**

Start by downloading and installing the appropriate prerequisite tools.
- [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://goo.gl/M0pH4i) to interact with a cloud foundry instance
- [Apache Maven](http://info.pivotal.io/HI002010A6ZlRJR1NeU00eC) to build labs using Maven
- [Gradle](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.1-all.zip) to build labs using Gradle
- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone Github repo or download and unzip

**Download materials**

Next, download the course materials.  This can be accomplished either through the GitHub website by downloading a repository zip and unzipping locally, or if you have Git installed, use the following commands:
